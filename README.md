# Chatty MCP

Oh, hello there! Meet **Chatty MCP**, your new best buddy who *loves* to chat out loud! After every request in Cursor, Cline, or any MCP-supported editor, it will speak up and summarize what was just done. Not only will you know when your long request has completed, but you can also use another sense to quickly understand what the editor produced, integrating deeply with your workflow for a better coding experience.

## Why?

1. Waiting for Cursor to complete your requests can be tedious - you're just staring at a black screen. With Chatty MCP, you can Alt+Tab to another window while Cursor is thinking, and return when you hear the voice announcement.
2. You don't need to read everything produced by your AI - just listen to the summary and quickly decide if it's going in the right direction, then make adjustments as needed.
3. Having your computer interact with you by voice is an interesting coding experience.

Additionally, this gives you the ability to customize the voice. Use your system's built-in TTS for convenience, Kokoro TTS for smooth and natural voice output, or even Fish TTS for anime-style voices in the future.

## How to Get and Configure Chatty

## Note

For Kokoro ONNX model to work, you must download the Kokoro model and place it in the correct directory. Check the documentation's Speech Engine section for more information.
